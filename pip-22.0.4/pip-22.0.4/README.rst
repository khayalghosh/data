pip - The Python Package Installer
==================================

pip is the `package installer`_ for Python. You can use pip to install packages from the `Python Package Index`_ and other indexes.

Please take a look at our documentation for how to install and use pip:

* `Installation`_
* `Usage`_

We release updates regularly, with a new version every 3 months. Find more details in our documentation:

* `Release notes`_
* `Release process`_

In pip 20.3, we've `made a big improvement to the heart of pip`_; `learn more`_. We want your input, so `sign up for our user experience research studies`_ to help us do it right.

**Note**: pip 21.0, in January 2021, removed Python 2 support, per pip's `Python 2 support policy`_. Please migrate to Python 3.
